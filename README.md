## 💡 How It Works

DebtGo uses the **Debt Avalanche Method**, which is mathematically proven to save you the most money:

1. Pay minimum payments on all debts
2. Put all extra money toward the debt with the highest interest rate
3. Once that's paid off, roll that payment into the next highest interest rate debt
4. Repeat until debt-free!
